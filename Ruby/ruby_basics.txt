# Ruby BEGIN Statement
   Declares code to be called before the program is run.
   Syntax:  BEGIN {
                code
            }

        Example:    puts "Hello, Nishchay Gupta." 
                    BEGIN {
                        puts "This is Ruby Learning!"
                    }  

        Output: This is Ruby Learning!
                Hello, Nishchay Gupta.



# Ruby END Statement
    Declares code to be called at the end of the program.   
    Syntax: END {
                code
            }

        Example:    puts "Hello, Nishchay Gupta." 
                    END {
                        puts "Completed Ruby Learning!"
                    }

        Output: Hello, Nishchay Gupta.
                Completed Ruby Learning!



# Ruby Comments
    A comment hides a line, part of a line, or several lines from the Ruby interpreter.

    SingleLined:   # I am a comment. Just ignore me.

    MultiLined:   =begin
                  This is a comment.
                  This is a comment, too.
                  This is a comment, too.
                  I said that already.
                  =end
