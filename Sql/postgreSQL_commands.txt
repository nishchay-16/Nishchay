PostgreSQL :-->
It is a powerful, open-source object-relational database management system (ORDBMS).
It has a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance. 

How to enter postgres terminal in terminal:- 
   command:  psql -U postgres


1)Creating and Managing Databases ---->

    Create a new database:-
        command: CREATE DATABASE <database_name>;

    List all databases:-
        command:  \l

    Connect to a database:-
        command: \c <database_name>

    DROP DATABASE mydatabase;
        command: DROP DATABASE <database_name>;


2)Creating and Managing Tables ---->

    Create a new table:-
        CREATE TABLE <table_name> (
          id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
          name VARCHAR(100),
          email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
        );

    List all tables:-
        command: \dt

    Describe a table (show table schema):-
        command: \d <table_name>

    Drop a table:-
        command: DROP TABLE <table_name>;


3)Inserting, Updating & Deleting Data ---->

    Insert data into a table:-
        command: INSERT INTO <table_name> (name, email) 
                 VALUES ('Nishchay', 'nishchay.gupta@berylsystems.com'),
                        ('Naman', 'naman.dua@berylsystems.com');
    
    Update data in a table:- 
        command: UPDATE <table_name> 
                 SET email = 'nishugupta123gupta@gmail.com' 
                 WHERE name = 'Nishchay';

    Delete data from a table:-
        command: DELETE FROM <table_name> 
                 WHERE name = 'Nishchay';


4)Constraints ----->

    UNIQUE:- It ensures that all values in a column are unique.
        command: CREATE TABLE <table_name> (
                    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
                    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
                 );

    NOT NULL:- It ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value.
        command: CREATE TABLE <table_name> (
                    id INT NOT NULL,
                    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
                    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
                 );

    DEFAULT:- It provides a default value for a column when none is specified.
        command: CREATE TABLE <table_name> (
                    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
                    name VARCHAR(100),
                    price DECIMAL(10, 2) DEFAULT 0.00
                 );

    PRIMARY KEY:- It uniquely identifies each record in a table. A primary key column cannot have NULL values and must contain unique values.
        command: CREATE TABLE <table_name> (
                    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
                    date DATE NOT NULL
                 );

    FOREIGN KEY:- It ensures the referential integrity of the data in one table to match values in another table.
        command: CREATE TABLE booking (
                    user_id INT , 
                    ticket_id INT, 
                    constraint fk_user FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id),
                    constraint fk_ticket FOREIGN KEY (ticket_id) REFERENCES ticket(ticket_id)
                 );

    CHECK:- It ensures that all values in a column satisfy a specific condition.
        command: CREATE TABLE users (
                    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
                    age INT CHECK (age >= 18)
                );


5)Alter Tables ---->

    Add a new column:-
        command: ALTER TABLE <table_name>
                 ADD <column_name> <datatype> <constraint>;

    Drop a column:- 
        command: ALTER TABLE <table_name>
                 DROP COLUMN <column_name>;

    Modify a column:-
        command: ALTER TABLE <table_name>
                 MODIFY COLUMN <column_name> <datatype> <constraint>;

    Rename a column:- 
        command: ALTER TABLE <table_name>
                 RENAME COLUMN <old_column_name> TO <new_column_name>;

    Rename a table:- 
        command: ALTER TABLE <old_table_name>
                 RENAME TO <new_table_name>;

    Adding constraint to table:-
        command: ALTER TABLE <table_name>
                 ADD CONSTRAINT <constraint_name> <constraint_type> <column_name>;

    Drop constraint from table:-
        command: ALTER TABLE <table_name>
                 DROP CONSTRAINT <constraint_name>;

    Changing column position:-
        command: ALTER TABLE <table_name>
                 MODIFY COLUMN <column_name> <datatype> <constraint> AFTER <another_column>;

    Enable constraint:-
        command: ALTER TABLE <table_name>
                 ENABLE CONSTRAINT <constraint_name>;

    Disable constraint:-
        command: ALTER TABLE <table_name>
                 DISABLE CONSTRAINT <constraint_name>;


6)Clauses ---->

    SELECT clause:-
        It is used to specify the columns to be returned in the query result.
        command: SELECT column1, column2 
                 FROM <table_name>;

    FROM clause:-
        It specifies the table or tables from which to retrieve the data.
        command: SELECT column1, column2

    GROUP BY clause:-
        It group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows.
        command: SELECT column1, COUNT(*) 
                 FROM <table_name>
                 GROUP BY column1;
    
    HAVING clause:-
        It filters groups based on specified conditions and used with GROUP BY clause.
        command: SELECT column1, COUNT(*) 
                 FROM <table_name> 
                 GROUP BY column1 
                 HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
    
    ORDER BY clause:- 
        It sorts the result set in ascending or descending order.
        command: SELECT column1, column2 
                 FROM <table_name>
                 ORDER BY column1 ASC, column2 DESC;
    
    LIMIT clause:-
        It limits the number of rows returned by the query.
        command: SELECT column1, column2 
                 FROM <table_name>
                 LIMIT number_of_rows;
    
    OFFSET clause:-
        It skips a specified number of rows before beginning to return the rows.
        command: SELECT column1, column2

                 INTERSECT
                 SELECT column1 FROM table2;

7) Views ----->
    Views are virtual tables that are based on the result of a SELECT query. 
    They do not store data physically but allow us to look at the data stored in tables.
    
    Creating a View:-
        command: CREATE VIEW <view_name> AS
                 SELECT column1, column2, ...
                 FROM <table_name>
                 WHERE condition;

    Updating a View:-
        command: UPDATE <view_name>
                 SET age = 17
                 WHERE user_id = 1802;

    Deleting rows from View:-
        command: DELETE FROM <view_name>
                 WHERE condition;

    Droping a View:-
        command: DROP VIEW <view_name>;


8) Schema ---->
        A schema is a named collection of tables. 
        A schema can also contain views, indexes, sequences, data types, operators, and functions. 
        It allows many users to use one database without interfering with each other.
        t organizes database objects into logical groups to make them more manageable.

    Create schema:-
        command: CREATE SCHEMA <schema_name>;

    Drop a schema:-
        command: DROP SCHEMA <schema_name>;

    Create a table in schema:-
        command: Create table myschema.company(
                    ID   INT              NOT NULL,
                    NAME VARCHAR (20)     NOT NULL,
                    AGE  INT              NOT NULL,
                    ADDRESS  CHAR (25),
                    SALARY   DECIMAL (18, 2),
                    PRIMARY KEY (ID)
                 );
    

9)TRANSACTIONS ---->
        It is a unit of work performed against a database .
	    It can be a unit or sequence of work accomplished in logical order, either manually or automatically.
        It is the propagation of one or more changes to the database
	    It is important to control transaction to ensure high data integrity and to handle database errors.

	Properties of transaction (ACID PROPERTIES):
			Atomicity - Ensures that all operations within the work unit are completed successfully otherwise, the transaction is aborted at the point of failure and previous operations are rolled back to their former state.
			Consistency - Ensures that the database properly changes states upon a successfully committed transaction.
			Isolation - Enables transactions to operate independently of and transparent to each other.
			Durabilty - Ensures that the result or effect of a committed transaction persists in case of a system failure

	Transaction Control Commands (used uith INSERT , UPDATE, DELETE):
			BEGIN TRANSACTION - It is used to start a transaction.
					command:  BEGIN | BEGIN TRANSACTION

			COMMIT -  It is used to save changes after the last commit .
                      It is the transactional command used to save changes invoked by a transaction to the database.
                      It saves all transactions to the database since the last COMMIT or ROLLBACK command.
					command:  COMMIT | END TRANSACTION

			ROLLBACK - It is used to rollback to the last commit.
                       It is the transactional command used to undo transactions that have not already been saved to the database.
					command:  ROLLBACK;
